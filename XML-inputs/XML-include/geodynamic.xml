				This ASCII file provides for each line the following information:
					- the node ID (which should match with one defined in the basement grid <StrataGrid>)
					- cumulative vertical displacement for each considered node in metres.

				Attention: The file defines the cumulative displacement during the duration defined 
					above and not a displacement rate.

				Note: the nodes have been defined in increasing order starting from the Sout-West
				 	corner and going first along the X axis (West to East)
