    <!-- Export of a 2D pseudo seismic section. The pseudo seismic section
        records along the X or Y direction the sedimentary layer
        characteristics.
        
        Two files are generated in the "runfiles" sub-directory of the output
        directory (<OutputDirectory> element). 
        The first one is the seismic data itself called "seismic.csv" and 
        records:
            - the position along the X or Y direction depending of the seismic 
                line orientation,
            - the layer top elevation,
            - the mean grain size for the considered layer and,
            - the average porosity for the considered layer.
        
        The second file represents the envelop of the seismic section and
        is called "envelop.csv" it records for each stratigraphic grid nodes
        present in the seismic line the top and bottom elevation.
        
        Note: the export is realised at the end of the simulation.
        
        Note: the section needs to be aligned with the mesh gridding
    
        Going beyond: These two files could then be further processed to create  
            regularly spaced grid interpolating the seismic data values using 
            Fatiando tools.
            Scripts have been developed to make this conversion and could be 
            provided if required.

    <!-- This plugin enable the soft coupling between Underworld geodynamic
        model and LECODE.
        
        To work the plugin requires that both Underworld and Lecode have been
        compiled on the same machine. In Underworld specific input parameters
        have to be turn on to enable the coupling.
        
        The communications between the codes are done at specific time steps and 
        are driven by a file called 'maestro' localised in a synchronisation
        folder known by the 2 codes.
        
        Lecode will provide to Underworld a VTK file containing top surface 
        information ('topsurface.vtk'). 
        Underworld will provide to Lecode an ASCII file containing vertical
        displacement fields ('uw_output.ascii').
        
        Note: the plugin only looks at vertical displacements.
