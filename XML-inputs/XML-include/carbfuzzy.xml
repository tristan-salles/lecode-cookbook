			The user can choose between 14 default membership variable names listed below:
				- "depth" : water depth in metres
				- "shore-distance" : distance in metres to shoreline
				- "river-distance" : distance in metres to nearest river source
				- "carbonate-distance" : distance in metres to nearest surface exposed carbonate
				- "organic-distance" : distance in metres to nearest surface exposed organic
				- "sedimentation-rate" : sedimentation rate in metres per year
				- "temperature" : surface temperature in Celsius
				- "salinity" : degree of salinity in ppm
				- "valley" : normalise number of surrounding points uphill from the reference 
					point (calculated from all grid points within two grid cells): 
						* -1 = all points downhill, 
						*  1 = all points uphill [-1,1].
				- "gradient" : average gradient of the point (calculated from all grid points 
					within two grid cells) negative value indicates that most surrounding 
					points are downhill from the point.
				- "exposed-time" : time the layer has been undisturbed on the surface in years.
				- "ocean-energy" : wind-induced wave and currents circulation velocity in the 
					area in m/s. You must have the plugin <OceanPlugin> turns on.
				- "burial" : depth to which the material has been buried by subsequent 
					deposits in metres (affects material subsurface).
				- "age" : time since the layer was deposited in years (affects material 
					subsurface).
