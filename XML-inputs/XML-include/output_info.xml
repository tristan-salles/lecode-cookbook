	<!-- Definition of the output directory where both simulation
		results and runfiles will be stored.
		The directory is divided in two sub-directories:
			- one called "outputs" which record simulation output
			- one called "runfiles" which record simulation informations
			
		Note: the "outputs" sub-directory contains time-series files that can be visualised
			in Paraview or Visit for both the TIN grid, recorded stratigraphic mesh and flow walkers
			evolution.
		
		Note: the "runfiles" sub-directory contains the checkpointing files required to restart 
			a simulation.
		
		Note: to preserve previous runs, change the output directory name otherwise it will be
			automatically rewritten and previous outputs will be lost.

	<!-- Sea-level fluctuations output control parameter. To save some space sea-level
		fluctuations outputs can be turned on and off. The value for this element can be: 
			- 0 meaning sea-level will not need to be visualised, 
			- 1 meaning sea-level fluctuations will be outputed (this is the default value). 
	
		Note: This element is optional.
