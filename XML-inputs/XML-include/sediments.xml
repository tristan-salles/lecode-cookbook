	<!-- Declaration of material classes present in the simulated domain. 
		The definition of the material classes starts with the declaration of the
	 	siliciclastics, then the carbonates and finally the organics. 
	 	
	 	Note: The total number of materials is equal to the sum of siliclastics, carbonates
	 		and organics. It is not required to set some materials for each type but it is 
	 		required to have at least one material defined. 
	 		
	 	Note: The total number of materials is set to 10 in the default version of LECODE. 
	 		If the simulation requires more grain sizes you will need to change the default
	 		value (called max_grn) within LECODE and recompile it. 
	 	
	 	Note: Each 3 types of materials needs to be organise by decreasing diametre size.

	<!-- Declaration of initial deposit layers prior to the simulation starting time.
		This element allows the user to start with a predefined sediment architecture.
		This architecture could be composed of several layers with various thicknesses
		througout the spatial area making it possible to set up initially complex 
		geometries. 
		
		Note: if your simulation starts without any predefined sedimentary layers, you will
			not be able to erode the basement and it is in any case required to set up a initial
			layer of null thicknesses.
		
		Note: in case of a restarted simulation the initial deposition layer declaration
			should not be changed from the original definition

			<!-- Name of a specific deposit layer file and its path.

					- thickness of last defined material classes on this node in metres
					- sedimentary layer hardness
				
				Note: the hardness of a given sedimentary layer is a parameter (always positive) 
					which defines how easy a specific layer can be eroded. A value of 1 or below 
					means that the layer erodability is high for this node whereas a value of 10 
					or above will means that the layer erodability is low and can be seen as a
					cemented rock.
					
				Note: In case a particular sediment is not present its thickness needs to be set 
					to 0.0.
				
				Note: the nodes have been defined in increasing order starting from the Sout-West
				 	corner and going first along the X axis (West to East)
				
				Attention: this is a requirement to defined the various sediment class thicknesses
					by following the same order as the one used in the definition of the different
					materials. If not the initial sedimentary layers will not be set properly.
